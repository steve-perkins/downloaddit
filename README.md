# downloaddit

Downloaddit is a Windows Desktop application for downloading Imgur-hosted 
photos posted on Reddit.  Downloaddit can scan and recognize all photos 
posted to a specific subreddit, or all photos posted by a specific user.

Of course, that's really just an excuse.  The main reason is simply to 
get more experience with WPF and XAML, and asynchronous concurrency 
with C# and .NET in general.
